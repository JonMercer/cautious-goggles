# Why I built it
Normal podcast apps have not innovated in the last few years despite massive improvements in ML/AI. This app aims to push the boundaries of what's possible. This app is built for the rare power-users that chew through a lot of content.

| Questions | Answers |
|---|---|
|When will this release?|I plan on having a lengthly beta to understand what you find valuable. Only then will I release. It could be 1 month or 1 year.|
|What else do you plan on building?| I'd like to throw AI into improving sound quality. I'd also like to detect voice fingerprints of each speaker. Caveat: I have no idea how to do this yet â€“ It can't be that hard, right? |
|You block ads?| It can, but it doesn't. Instead, when repeat content (previews, intros, ads) gets played, the app gives you an option to skip to the end of it. I'm trying to find a responsible way to approach this because I personally find ads useful. I want to make sure podcasters are making money but I also want to improve the listening experience. I'm open to suggestions from users and Podcasters. |
|Won't you disappear in a few months? | I've been listening to podcasts since 2005. I'll probably be listening to podcasts for another 10+ years. So I'm incentivised to keep my own app alive.|
